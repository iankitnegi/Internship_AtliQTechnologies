> ### E-Mail #2:  
> **DATA NORMALIZATION TASK**  
> Well done with the previous task. I have a new one for you.  
One of our client projects requires a minor support. The dataset is currently in a de-normalized form, and we need your help to transform it into a normalized form.  
Your task will involve creating proper fact and dimension tables based on the dataset, which can be found in the "fact_order_lines.csv" file. Providing a few screenshots of the dataset below, which will give you a better idea of what it looks like and how the final output should be presented
